This package allows you to convert PHP classes to TypeScript.

This class...

```php
#[TypeScript]
class User
{
    public int $id;
    public string $name;
    public ?string $address;
}
```

... will be converted to this TypeScript type:

```ts
export type User = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    address: string | null;
}
```

Here's another example.

```php
enum Languages: string
{
    case TYPESCRIPT = 'typescript';
    case PHP = 'php';
}
```

The `Languages` enum will be converted to:

```tsx
export type Languages = 'typescript' | 'php';
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/typescript-transformer
```

## Setting up TypeScript transformer

We first need to initialize typescript-transformer and configure what it exactly should do. If you're using Laravel,
please skip to the next section.

Since TypeScript transformer is framework-agnostic, we cannot provide you exact steps on how to integrate it into your
application. However, we can provide you with a general idea of how to do it.

Ideally, TypeScript transformer is a CLI command within your application, that can be quickly called when you need to
generate TypeScript types.

Within Symphony, for example, you can create a command like this:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptTransformer;
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptTransformerConfigFactory;

class GenerateTypeScriptCommand extends Command
{
    protected static $defaultName = 'typescript:transform';

    protected function configure()
    {
        $this->setDescription('Transform TypeScript types');
    }

    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output)
    {
        $config = TypeScriptTransformerConfigFactory::create(); // We'll come back to this in a minute

        TypeScriptTransformer::create($config)->execute();
    }
}
```

When you've registered the command, it can be executed as such:

```bash
php bin/console typescript:transform
```

Since we haven't configured TypeScript transformer yet, this command won't do anything. Skip the Laravel section and
continue with the next section to learn how to configure TypeScript transformer.

### Laravel

When using Laravel, first install the specific `TypeScriptTransformerServiceProvider`:

```bash
php artisan typescript:install
```

This command will create a `TypeScriptTransformerServiceProvider` in your `app/Providers` directory. Which looks like
this:

```php
class TypeScriptTransformerServiceProvider extends BaseTypeScriptTransformerServiceProvider
{
    protected function configure(TypeScriptTransformerConfigFactory $config): void
    {
        $config; // We'll come back to this in a minute
    }
}
```

And it will also register the service provider in your `bootstrap/providers.php` file (when running Laravel 11 or
above). Or in your `config/app.php` file when running Laravel 10 or below.

Now you can transform types as such:

```bash
php artisan typescript:transform
```

Since we haven't configured TypeScript transformer yet, this command won't do anything. Let's do that now.

## Running TypeScript Transformer for the first time

TypeScript transformer is a highly configurable framework to transform PHP classes and more into TypeScript types, we
provide some highly used functionality out of the box, but you can configure it to your needs.

We're going to start with transforming basic PHP classes to TypeScript types, this is what the package actually does:

1. It starts searching for PHP classes within your application
2. It makes a ReflectionClass from each of these found classes
3. These ReflectionClasses are then processed by a list of transformers (they take a ReflectionClass and try to make a
   TypeScript type from it)
4. If a ReflectionClass is transformed, it is added to a list to be written to TypeScript otherwise the class is ignored
5. That list is then written to a TypeScript file

Transformers are the most important part in this whole process, they implement the `Transformer` interface which looks
like this:

```php
interface Transformer
{
    public function transform(ReflectionClass $reflectionClass, TransformationContext $context): Transformed|Untransformable;
}
```

By default, the package comes with a few transformers:

- `EnumTransformer`: Transforms PHP enums to TypeScript enums
- `ClassTransformer`: Transforms PHP classes with its properties to TypeScript types (abstract, read on for more info)
- `AttributedClassTransformer`: A special version of the `ClassTransformer` that only transforms classes with
  the `#[TypeScript]` attribute
- `LaravelClassTransformer`: A special version of the `ClassTransformer` with some goodies for Laravel users

You're free to mix and match these transformers to your needs, or even create your own transformers.

Registering can be done as such within your TypeScript CLI command or `TypeScriptTransformerServiceProvider` (if you're
using Laravel):

```php
$config->transformer(AttributedClassTransformer::class);
```

Since transformers are just PHP classes, you can also pass them arguments when initializing them:

```php
$config->transformer(new EnumTransformer(useNativeEnums: true)); // transformers enums as TypeScript native enums and not as a union of strings
```

Quick note: transformers are executed in the order they are registered in the configuration, when a transformer cannot
transform a class, the next transformer is checked.

Transformers work on PHP classes, we need to tell TypeScript transformer where to look for these classes. This can be
done by adding a directory to the configuration:

```php
$config->watchDirectories(app_path());
```

We're almost done! The last thing we need to do is tell TypeScript transformer how to write types, this can be done by
using the `NamespaceWriter` which writes all types to a single TypeScript file with namespaces:

```ts
declare namespace App.Data {
    export type PostData = {
        title: string;
        slug: string;
        type: App.Enums.PostType;
        tags: Array<string>;
        publish_date: string | null;
        published: boolean;
    };
}
declare namespace App.Enums {
    export type PostType = 'news' | 'blog';
}
```

You can configure this writer and where it should put the file as such:

```php
$config->writeTypes(new NamespaceWriter(resource_path('types/generated.d.ts'))); 
```

If you want a file per namespace, then you can use the `ModuleWriter`, it will write a structure like this:

```ts
// app/data/index.d.ts
export type PostData = {
    title: string;
    slug: string;
    type: App.Enums.PostType;
    tags: Array<string>;
    publish_date: string | null;
    published: boolean;
};

// app/enums/index.d.ts
export type PostType = 'news' | 'blog';
```

You can configure it like this:

```php
$config->writeTypes(new ModuleWriter(resource_path('types'))); 
```

That's it! You're now ready to transform your PHP classes to TypeScript types. If you've configured
the `EnumTransformer` then, every enum should be transformed to TypeScript. When using the `AttributedClassTransformer`,
be sure to add the `#[TypeScript]` attribute to classes you want transformed.

### Special attributes

Classes can have attributes that change the way they are transformed, let's go through them.

Using the `#[TypeScript]` attribute is not only a way to tell typescript-transformer to transform a class, but it can
also be used to change the name of the transformed class:

```php
#[TypeScript(name: 'UserWithoutEmail')]
class User
{
    public int $id;
    public string $name;
}
```

This will transform the `User` class to `UserWithoutEmail` in TypeScript.

```ts
export type UserWithoutEmail = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
}
```

Each type will be located somewhere either being a file when using the `ModuleWriter` or in a single file when using
the `NamespaceWriter`. The location of the type can be changed by using the `#[TypeScript]` attribute:

```php
#[TypeScript(location: ['Data', 'Users'])]
class User
{
    public int $id;
    public string $name;
}
```

This will transform as such:

```ts
declare namespace Data.Users {
    export type User = {
        id: number;
        name: string;
    };
}
```

It is possible to completely remove a class from the TypeScript output by using the `#[Hidden]` attribute:

```php
#[Hidden]
enum Members: string
{
    case John = 'john';
    case Paul = 'paul';
    case George = 'george';
    case Ringo = 'ringo';
}
```

This is particularly useful when using the `EnumTransformer` and you want to hide certain enums from the TypeScript.

## Making sure PHP classes are typed

The first run of TypeScript transformer might not have the desired result, a lot of property types could be `undefined`
because TypeScript transformer doesn't know what type these properties are, let's fix that!

Typescript transformer will automatically transform basic PHP types as such:

```php
class Types 
{
    public string $property; // string
    public int $property; // number
    public float $property; // number
    public bool $property; // boolean
    public mixed $property; // any
    public object $property; // object
}
```

When a type is nullable, TypeScript transformer will transform it as such:

```php
class Types 
{
    public ?string $property; // string | null
}
```

Unions and intersections are also supported:

```php
class Types 
{
    public string | int $property; // string | number
    public string & int $property; // string & number
}
```

Arrays in PHP can be transformed to two types in TypeScript, if no types are annotated, an array will become an `Array`.
When an array is typed with integer keys it will still be an Array. An array typed with string keys will become
a `Record`:

```php
class Types 
{
    public array $property; // Array
    
    /** @var bool[] */
    public array $property; // Array<boolean>

    /** @var array<int, bool> */
    public array $property; // Array<boolean>

    /** @var array<string, bool> */
    public array $property; // Record<string, boolean>
}
```

As you can see, when an array value is typed correctly, it will also be typed correctly in TypeScript.

It is also possible to use non-typical array key types, like an enum:

```php
class Types 
{
    /** @var array<PostType, string> */
    public array $property; // Record<'news'|'blog', string>
}
```

It is possible to define array shapes like this:

```php
class Types 
{
    /** @var array{age: int, name: string} */
    public array $property; // { age: number, name: string }
}
```

There are multiple locations where you can add property annotations:

```php
/**
* @property string[] $propertyA 
 */
class Types
{
    public array $propertyA;
    
    /** @var string[] */
    public array $propertyB;

    /**
    * @param string[] $propertyC
     */
    public function __construct(
        public array $propertyC
    ) {
    
    }
}
```

Typing objects works like magic:

```php
class Types 
{
    // App.Enums.PostType (when using the NamespaceWriter)
    // Import { PostType } from '../enums' + PostType (when using the ModuleWriter)
    public PostType $property;    
}
```

If a typed object is not transformed and thus we don't know how it will look like in TypeScript, it will be replaced
by `unknown`. It is possible to replace these unknown types with a TypeScript type, without transforming them, keep
reading to learn how to do that.

You can also type generic properties:

```php
class Types 
{
    /** @var Collection<int, string> */
    public Collection $property; // Illuminate.Support.Collection<number, string>
}
```

Properties can be made optional in TypeScript by adding the `#[Optional]` attribute:

```php
class Types 
{
    #[Optional]
    public string $property;
}
```

Transforming this class will result in the following object:

```ts
export type Types = {
    property?: string;
}
```

It is possible to hide properties from the TypeScript object by adding the `#[Hidden]` attribute:

```php
class Types 
{
    #[Hidden]
    public string $property;
}
```

When you want to replace a property type with a literal TypeScript type, you can use the `#[LiteralTypeScriptType]`
attribute:

```php
class Types 
{
    #[LiteralTypeScriptType('Record<Uppercase<string>, string>')]
    public array $property;
}
```

You can also create a TypeScript object from literal types:

```php
class Types 
{
    #[LiteralTypeScriptType([
        'age' => 'number',
        'name' => 'string',
    ])]
    public array $property;
}
```

This will result in the following TypeScript object:

```ts
export type Types = {
    property: {
        age: number;
        name: string;
    };
}
```

It is also possible to type properties using php types within an attribute using the `#[TypeScriptType]` attribute:

```php
class Types 
{
    #[TypeScriptType('string')]
    public $property;
}
```

Also, this attribute can be used to type an object, but this time the types can be PHP types:

```php
class Types 
{
    #[TypeScriptType([
        'age' => 'int',
        'name' => 'string',
    ])]
    public $property;
}
```

## Replacing common types

Some PHP classes should be transformed into a TypeScript object, an example of this is the `DateTime` class. When you
send such an object to the front it will be represented by a string rather than an object. TypeScript transformer allows
you to replace these kinds types with an appropriate TypeScript type.

Replacing types can be done in the config:

```php
$config->replaceType(DateTime::class, 'string');
```

Now all `DateTime` objects will be transformed to a string in TypeScript. This also includes inherited classes
like `Carbon`, those will also be transformed to a string.

When using an interface like `DateTimeInterface` you can also replace it with a TypeScript type:

```php
$config->replaceType(DateTimeInterface::class, 'string');
```

All classes that implement `DateTimeInterface` will be transformed to a string in TypeScript.

### Replacements

As we've seen before it is possible to replace types by writing them out like you would do in an annotation, this allows
you to build complex types, for example:

```php
$config->replaceType(DateTimeInterface::class, 'array{day: int, month: int, year: int}');
```

From now on, all `DateTimeInterface` objects will be replaced by the following TypeScript object:

```ts
{
    day: number;
    month: number;
    year: number;
}
```

It is also possible to define a replacement as an internal TypeScript node(more on that later):

```php
$config->replaceType(DateTimeInterface::class, new TypeScriptString());
```

Or use a closure to define the replacement:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptNodes\TypeReference;

$config->replaceType(DateTimeInterface::class, function (TypeReference $reference) {
    return new TypeScriptString();
});
```

## TypeScript nodes

Internally the package uses TypeScript nodes to represent TypeScript types, these nodes can be used to build complex
types and it is possible to create your own nodes.

For example, a TypeScript alias is representing a User object will look like this:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptNodes;

new TypeScriptAlias(
    new TypeScriptIdentifier('User'),
    new TypeScriptObject([
        new TypeScriptProperty('id', new TypeScriptNumber()),
        new TypeScriptProperty('name', new TypeScriptString()),
        new TypeScriptProperty('address', new TypeScriptUnion([
            new TypeScriptString(),
            new TypeScriptNull(),
        ])),
    ]),
);
```

Transforming this alias to TypeScript will result in the following type:

```ts
type User = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    address: string | null;
}
```

There are a lot of TypeScript nodes available, you can find them in the `Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScript`
namespace. In the advanced section we'll take a look at how to build your own TypeScript nodes.

## Creating a transformer

Transformers are the most important part of TypeScript transformer, they take a PHP class and try to transform it to a
TypeScript type. A transformer implements the `Transformer` interface:

```php
interface Transformer
{
    public function transform(ReflectionClass $reflectionClass, TransformationContext $context): Transformed|Untransformable;
}
```

The `TransformationContext` contains all the information you need to transform a class:

```php
class TransformationContext
{
    public function __construct(
        // The name for the class that is being transformed, can be user defined
        public string $name,
        // The segments of the namespace where the class is located
        public array $nameSpaceSegments,
    ) {
    }
}
```

Within the method a `Transformed` data object should be created and returned which looks like this:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\References\ClassStringReference;

new Transformed(
    // The TypeScript node representing the transformed class
    typeScriptNode: $typeScriptNode,
    // A unique name for the transformed class 
    reference: new ClassStringReference($reflectionClass->getName()),
    // A location where the class should be written to
    // By default, this is the namespace of the class and the $nameSpaceSegments from the TransformationContext can be used
    location: $context->nameSpaceSegments,
    // Whether the type should be exported in TypeScript
    export: true,
);
```

If a class cannot be transformed, the `Untransformable` object should be returned:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Untransformable;

Untransformable::create();
```

When a class cannot be transformed, the next transformer in the list will be executed.

### Extending the class Transformer

Most of the time, transforming a class comes down to taking all the properties and transforming them to a TypeScript
object with properties, the package provides an easy-to-extend class for this called `ClassTransformer`.

You can create your own version by extending the `ClassTransformer` and implementing the `shouldTransform` method:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Transformers\ClassTransformer;

class MyTransformer extends ClassTransformer
{
    protected function shouldTransform(ReflectionClass $reflection): bool
    {
        return $reflection->implementsInterface(\Spatie\LaravelData\Data::class);
    }
}
```

In the case above, the transformer will only run when transforming classes which are data objects from
the [laravel-data](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-data) package. We encourage you to overwrite certain methods so
that the transformer fits your needs.

#### Choosing properties to transform

By default, all public non-static properties of a class are transformed, but you can overwrite the `properties` method
to change this:

```php
protected function getProperties(ReflectionClass $reflection): array
{
    return $reflection->getProperties(ReflectionProperty::IS_PUBLIC|ReflectionProperty::IS_PROTECTED);
}
```

#### Optional properties

It is possible to make a property optional in TypeScript by overwriting the `isPropertyReadonly` method:

```php
protected function isPropertyOptional(
    ReflectionProperty $reflectionProperty,
    ReflectionClass $reflectionClass,
    TypeScriptNode $type,
    TransformationContext $context,
): bool {
    return str_starts_with($reflectionProperty->getName(), '_');
}
```

By default, we check whether a property has an `#[Optional]` attribute.

#### Readonly properties

You can make a property readonly by overwriting the `isPropertyReadonly` method:

```php
protected function isPropertyReadonly(
    ReflectionProperty $reflectionProperty,
    ReflectionClass $reflectionClass,
    TypeScriptNode $type,
): bool {
   return str_ends_with($reflectionProperty->getName(), 'Read');
}
```

By default, we check whether a property was made readonly in PHP.

#### Hiding properties

It is possible to completely hide a property from the TypeScript object by overwriting the `isPropertyHidden` method:

```php
protected function isPropertyHidden(
    ReflectionProperty $reflectionProperty,
    ReflectionClass $reflectionClass,
    TypeScriptProperty $property,
): bool {
    return count($reflectionProperty->getAttributes(Hidden::class)) > 0;
}
```

By default, we check whether a property has an `#[Hidden]` attribute.

#### Class property processors

Sometimes a more fine-grained control is needed over how a property is transformed, this is where class property
processors come to play. They allow you to update the TypeScript Node of the property, you can create them by
implementing the `ClassPropertyProcessor` interface:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Transformers\ClassPropertyProcessors\ClassPropertyProcessor;

class RemoveNullProcessor implements ClassPropertyProcessor
{
    public function execute(
        ReflectionProperty $reflection,
        ?TypeNode $annotation,
        TypeScriptProperty $property
    ): ?TypeScriptProperty {
        if ($property->type instanceof TypeScriptUnion) {
            $property->type = new TypeScriptUnion(
                array_values(array_filter($property->type->types, fn (TypeScriptNode $type) => !$type instanceof TypeScriptNull))
            );
        }

        return $property;
    }
}
```

You can add these processors to the transformer by overwriting the `classPropertyProcessors` method:

```php
protected function classPropertyProcessors(): array
{
    return [
        new RemoveNullProcessor(),
    ];
}
```

A class property processor can also be used to remove properties from the TypeScript object:

```php
class RemoveAllStrings implements ClassPropertyProcessor
{
    public function execute(
        ReflectionProperty $reflection,
        ?TypeNode $annotation,
        TypeScriptProperty $property
    ): ?TypeScriptProperty {
        if ($property->type instanceof TypeScriptString) {
            return null;
        }

        return $property;
    }
}
```

## Creating a TypesProvider

Until now we've only taken a look at transforming PHP classes to TypeScript, but what if you want to transform something
else? This is where the `TypesProvider` comes in, it is a class that provides TypeScript types. The transformers
we've seen before are actually bundled in a default `TypesProvider` provided by the package.

A `TypesProvider` implements the `TypeProvider` interface:

```php
namespace Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeProviders;

use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Collections\TransformedCollection;
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptTransformerConfig;

interface TypesProvider
{
    public function provide(
        TypeScriptTransformerConfig $config,
        TransformedCollection $types
    ): void;
}
```

The `provide` method is called when the TypeScript transformer is executed, it should add `Transformed` objects to the
collection provided. We could for example add a generic type which transforms Laravel collections:

```php
class AddLaravelCollectionProvider implements TypesProvider
{
    public function provide(
        TypeScriptTransformerConfig $config,
        TransformedCollection $types
    ): void {
        $types->add(new Transformed(
            typeScriptNode: new TypeScriptAlias(
                new TypeScriptGeneric(
                    new TypeScriptIdentifier('Collection'),
                    [new TypeScriptIdentifier('T')],
                ),
                new TypeScriptGeneric(
                    new TypeScriptIdentifier('Array'),
                    [new TypeScriptIdentifier('T')],
                ),
            ),
            reference: new ClassStringReference(Collection::class),
            location: ['Illuminate', 'Support']
        ));
    }
}
```

When we register the provider as such in the configuration:

```php
$config->addProvider(new AddLaravelCollectionProvider());
```

Our transformed TypeScript will have the following type:

```ts
namespace Illuminate.Support {
    export type Collection<T> = Array<T>;
}
```

When referencing a Laravel collection in one of our PHP classes like this:

```php
class Data 
{
    /** @var Collection<string>  */
    public Collection $collection;
}
```

The transformed TypeScript will look like this:

```ts
export type Data = {
    collection: Illuminate.Support.Collection<string>;
}
```

## Referencing types

Types sometimes reference other types like PHP classes referencing other PHP classes. Within the package a concept of
references is used to link these types together.

When creating `Transformed` objects we've always used the `ClassStringReference` since we were referencing PHP classes,
sometimes you might be transforming something which is not a PHP class for example a list of strings. In this case, you
can use a `CustomReference`:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\References\CustomReference;

new Transformed(
    typeScriptNode: new TypeScriptAlias(
        new TypeScriptIdentifier('Type'),
        new TypeScriptUnion([new TypeScriptLiteral('PHP'), new TypeScriptLiteral('TypeScript')]),
    ),
    reference: new CustomReference('my_languages_package', 'some_languages'),
    location: ['App', 'Languages'],
);
```

A custom reference should be unique for each type, that's why it is built up from a group and a name. We advise you when
creating a package (or if you're implementing a feature within your app) to choose a custom group name in order not to
conflict with other packages.

In the end the transformed TypeScript will look like this:

```ts
namespace App.Languages {
    export type Type = 'PHP' | 'TypeScript';
}
```

It is possible to reference this type in another `Transformed` object:

```php
new Transformed(
    typeScriptNode: new TypeScriptAlias(
        new TypeScriptIdentifier('Compiler'),
        new TypeScriptObject([
            new TypeScriptProperty('type', new CustomTypeReference('my_languages_package', 'some_languages')),
        ]),
    ),
    reference: new ClassStringReference(Compiler::class),
    location: ['App', 'Compilers'],
);
```

The transformed TypeScript now will look like this:

```ts
namespace App.Compilers {
    export type Compiler = {
        type: App.Languages.Type;
    };
}
```

Since we're using the same reference, the package is smart enough to link them together when transforming to TypeScript.

Off course, you can also reference PHP classes in the same way:

```php
new Transformed(
    typeScriptNode: new TypeScriptAlias(
        new TypeScriptIdentifier('Post'),
        new TypeScriptObject([
            new TypeScriptProperty('publisher', new TypeScriptReference(new ClassStringReference(User::class))),
        ]),
    ),
    reference: new ClassStringReference(User::class),
    location: ['App', 'Models'],
);
```

## Formatting TypeScript

The package tries to format the transformed TypeScript as good as possible, but sometimes this could be far from
perfect. That's why it is possible to automatically format the TypeScript code after transforming.

By default, the package has support for two formatters:

- `PrettierFormatter`: Formats the TypeScript code using Prettier
- `EslintFormatter`: Formats the TypeScript code using ESLint

You can add a formatter to the configuration like this:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Formatters\PrettierFormatter;

$config->formatter(new PrettierFormatter());
```

It is possible to create your own formatter by implementing the `Formatter` interface:

```php
interface Formatter
{
    public function format(array $files): void;
}
```

The `$files` array contains the TypeScript files that need to be formatted, you can format them in any way you like.

## Advanced concepts

The package is highly configurable and can be extended in many ways, let's take a look at some advanced concepts.

### Building your own TypeScript node

The package comes with a lot of TypeScript nodes, but sometimes it might be necessary to build your own.

A TypeScript node is a regular PHP class that implements the `TypeScriptNode` interface:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Support\WritingContext;
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptNodes\TypeScriptNamedNode;
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptNodes\TypeScriptNode;

class PickNode implements TypeScriptNode, TypeScriptNamedNode
{
    public function __construct(
        private TypeScriptNode $type,
        private array $properties,
    ) {}

    public function write(WritingContext $context): string
    {
        return 'Pick<' . $this->type->write($context) . ', ' . implode(' | ', $this->properties) . '>';
    }
    
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'Pick';
    }
}
```

The write method is responsible for transforming the TypeScript node to a string, the `WritingContext` object is passed
to lower level TypeScript nodes to reference other TypeScript types and can generally be ignored.

Some TypeScript nodes represent a type with a name like an interface, enum, ... these nodes should implement
the `TypeScriptNamedNode` interface. The `getName` method should return the name of the TypeScript node so that it can
be referenced by other TypeScript nodes.

When you've got a node which itself contains another TypeScript node that can be a `TypeScriptNamedNode` we recommend
you to implement `TypeScriptForwardingNamedNode`. This interface requires you to implement the `getForwardedNamedNode`
method which should return the TypeScript node that either is another `TypeScriptForwardingNamedNode`
or `TypeScriptNamedNode`. An example of such a node is the `TypeScriptAlias`:

```php
class TypeScriptAlias implements TypeScriptForwardingNamedNode, TypeScriptNode
{
    public function __construct(
        public TypeScriptIdentifier|TypeScriptGeneric $identifier,
        public TypeScriptNode $type,
    ) {
    }

    public function write(WritingContext $context): string
    {
        return "type {$this->identifier->write($context)} = {$this->type->write($context)};";
    }

    public function getForwardedNamedNode(): TypeScriptNamedNode|TypeScriptForwardingNamedNode
    {
        return $this->identifier;
    }
}
```

Lastly, the package also provides some tooling to visit a tree of all TypeScript nodes, when your custom node is
encapsulating other TypeScript nodes you should implement the `TypeScriptVisitableNode` interface which requires you to
implement the visitorProfile method.

The `visitorProfile` method should return a `VisitorProfile` object which contains information about the properties
of your TypeScript node PHP class that can be visited. We extinguish two types of properties: single nodes properties
containing a single node and iterable properties containing a set of properties.

The `TypeScriptGeneric` node is an excellent example:

```php
class TypeScriptGeneric implements TypeScriptForwardingNamedNode, TypeScriptNode, TypeScriptVisitableNode
{
    /**
     * @param  array<TypeScriptNode>  $genericTypes
     */
    public function __construct(
        public TypeScriptIdentifier|TypeReference $type,
        public array $genericTypes,
    ) {
    }

    public function visitorProfile(): VisitorProfile
    {
        return VisitorProfile::create()->single('type')->iterable('genericTypes');
    }

    // ....
}
```

It contains a single node property `type` and an iterable property `genericTypes`. From now on the package will visit
the nodes within these properties.

### Visiting TypeScript nodes

When working with TypeScript nodes in a class property processor or a custom TypeScript node, it might be necessary to
visit and alter nodes in the tree. The `Visitor` class can be used to visit such a tree of TypeScript
nodes.

The visitor will start in a node and then traverse the tree of TypeScript nodes, it is possible to register a `before`
and `after` callback for each node it visits. The `before` callback is called before visiting the children of a node and
the `after` callback is called after visiting the children of a node.

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Visitor\Visitor;

Visitor::create()
    ->before(function (TypeScriptNode $node){
        echo 'Before visiting ' . $node::class . PHP_EOL;
    })
    ->after(function (TypeScriptNode $node) {
        echo 'After visiting ' . $node::class . PHP_EOL;
    })
    ->execute($rootNode);
```

When running the visitor on the following node:

```php
$rootNode = new TypeScriptUnion([
    new TypeScriptString(),
    new TypeScriptNumber(),
]);
```

The output will be (redacted for readability):

```
Before visiting TypeScriptUnion
Before visiting TypeScriptString
After visiting TypeScriptString
Before visiting TypeScriptNumber
After visiting TypeScriptNumber
After visiting TypeScriptUnion
```

By default, the visitor will visit the tree of nodes and run the callback on each node within the tree. It is possible
to limit the types of nodes the callback runs on:

```php
Visitor::create()
    ->after(function (TypeScriptUnion $node, [TypeScriptUnion::class]) {
        // Do something with TypeScriptUnion nodes
    })
    ->execute($rootNode);
```

When not returning a TypeScript node from the callback, the visitor will continue traversing the tree. It is possible to
replace a node in the tree like this:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Visitor\VisitorOperation;

Visitor::create()
    ->after(function (TypeScriptUnion $node, [TypeScriptUnion::class]) {
        if(count($node->types) === 1) {
            return VisitorOperation::replace(array_values($node->types)[0]);
        }  
    })
    ->execute($rootNode);
```

The visitor above will replace all union nodes with a single type with that type.

It is also possible to remove a node from the tree:

```php
Visitor::create()
    ->after(function (TypeScriptString $node, [TypeScriptString::class]) {
        return VisitorOperation::remove();
    })
    ->execute($rootNode);
```

### Hooking into TypeScript transformer

Every time the TypeScript transformer is executed, it will go through a series of steps, it is possible to run a visitor
in between some of these steps.

The steps look as following:

1. Running of the TypeProviders creating a collection of Transformed types
2. Possible hooking point: `providedVisitorHook`
3. Connecting references between Transformed types
4. Possible hooking point: `connectedVisitorHook`
5. Create a collection of WriteableFiles
6. Write those files to disk
7. Format the files

The two hooking points below can be used to run a visitor on the collection of Transformed types:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Visitor\VisitorClosureType;

$config->providedVisitorHook(
    fn(TransformedCollection $collection) => Visitor::create()->execute($collection),
    [TypeScriptUnion::class],
    VisitorClosureType::Before
);

$config->connectedVisitorHook(
    fn(TransformedCollection $collection) => Visitor::create()->execute($collection),
    [TypeScriptUnion::class],
    VisitorClosureType::Before
);
```

Running visitors as an after hook is also possible:

```php
$config->providedVisitorHook(
    fn(TransformedCollection $collection) => Visitor::create()->execute($collection),
    [TypeScriptUnion::class],
    VisitorClosureType::After
);

$config->connectedVisitorHook(
    fn(TransformedCollection $collection) => Visitor::create()->execute($collection),
    [TypeScriptUnion::class],
    VisitorClosureType::After
);
```

### Building your own Writer

Writers are responsible for writing out the TypeScript types, the package comes with three writers:

- `NamespaceWriter`: Writes all types to a single TypeScript file with namespaces
- `ModuleWriter`: Writes all types to a file per namespace
- `FlatWriter`: Writes all types to a single TypeScript file without namespaces

It is possible to create your own writer by implementing the `Writer` interface:

```php
use Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Support\WriteableFile;

interface Writer
{
    /** @return array<WriteableFile> */
    public function write(
        TransformedCollection $collection,
        ReferenceMap $referenceMap,
    ): void;
}
```

In the end the `write` method should return an array of `WriteableFile` objects, these objects contain the TypeScript
code and the location where it should be written to.

In the writer you should loop over each `Transformed` object in the collection, decide in which file it should be stored
and transform the TypeScript node to a string:

```php
foreach ($collection as $transformed) {
    $output .= $transformed->prepareForWrite()->write($writingContext) . PHP_EOL;
}
```

The `prepareForWrite` method will make sure that a TypeScript node is exported when required. The `write` method will
transform the TypeScript node to a string and requires a `WritingContext` object with information about the writing
context.

For now the `WritingContext` consists of a Closure returning a string referencing other TypeScript types. We recommend
you to take a look at the `FlatWriter` to see how this is implemented.
