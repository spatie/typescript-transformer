## Basic installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/typescript-transformer
```

If you're using Laravel, you should install the Laravel specific package instead:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer
```

You can find the full Laravel installation and setup instructions [here](/docs/typescript-transformer/v3/laravel/installation-and-setup).
