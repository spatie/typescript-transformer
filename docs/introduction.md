This package allows you to convert PHP classes & more to TypeScript.

This class...

```php
#[TypeScript]
class User
{
    public int $id;
    public string $name;
    public ?string $address;
}
```

... will be converted to this TypeScript type:

```ts
export type User = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    address: string | null;
}
```

Here's another example.

```php
enum Languages: string
{
    case TYPESCRIPT = 'typescript';
    case PHP = 'php';
}
```

The `Languages` enum will be converted to:

```tsx
export type Languages = 'typescript' | 'php';
```

And that's just the beginning! TypeScript transformer can handle complex types, generics and even allows you to create
TypeScript functions.
