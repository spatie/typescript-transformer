## Basic installation

You can install this package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer
```

The package will automatically register a service provider.

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\LaravelTypeScriptTransformer\TypeScriptTransformerServiceProvider"
```

This is the default content of the config file:

```php
<?php

return [
    /*
     * The paths where typescript-transformer will look for PHP classes
     * to transform, this will be the `app` path by default.
     */

    'auto_discover_types' => [
        app_path()
    ],

    /*
     * Collectors will search for classes in the `auto_discover_types` paths and choose the correct
     * transformer to transform them. By default, we include a DefaultCollector which will search
     * for @typescript annotated and ![TypeScript] attributed classes to transform.
     */

    'collectors' => [
        Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Collectors\DefaultCollector::class,
    ],

    /*
     * Transformers take PHP classes(e.g., enums) as an input and will output
     * a TypeScript representation of the PHP class.
     */

    'transformers' => [
        Spatie\LaravelTypeScriptTransformer\Transformers\SpatieStateTransformer::class,
        Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Transformers\SpatieEnumTransformer::class,
        Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Transformers\DtoTransformer::class,
    ],

    /*
     * In your classes, you sometimes have types that should always be replaced
     * by the same TypeScript representations. For example, you can replace a
     * Datetime always with a string. You define these replacements here.
     */

    'default_type_replacements' => [
        DateTime::class => 'string',
        DateTimeImmutable::class => 'string',
        Carbon\CarbonImmutable::class => 'string',
        Carbon\Carbon::class => 'string',
    ],

    /*
     * The package will write the generated TypeScript to this file.
     */

    'output_file' => resource_path('types/generated.d.ts'),

    /*
     * When the package is writing types to the output file, a writer is used to
     * determine the format. By default, this is the `TypeDefinitionWriter`.
     * But you can also use the `ModuleWriter` or implement your own.
     */

    'writer' => Spatie\TypeScriptTransformer\Writers\TypeDefinitionWriter::class,

    /*
     * The generated TypeScript file can be formatted. We ship two formatters by
     * default: a Prettier and an ESLint one. You can also implement your own.
     * The generated TypeScript will not be formatted if none is configured.
     */

    'formatter' => null,

    /*
     * Enums can be transformed into types or native TypeScript enums, by default
     * the package will transform them to types.
     */
    
    'transform_to_native_enums' => false,
    
    /*
     * When set to true, the package will search for types by short name 
     * when it doesn't find a type by FQN. 
     * 
     * This is useful when using the PhpDocTransformer, 
     * since it doesn't know the FQN of the type (when 'use' statements are used).
     */
     'fuzzy_search' => false,
